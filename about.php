            <div class="text">
                <p>Like any other girl, I've always dreamed of having healthy, beautiful hair. My passion for hair
                    and skincare began as a personal journey, full of experiments to find the right solution,
                    especially after the economic crisis and the import halt.</p>

                <p>But I always felt something was missing. Imported products were overpriced, while local options
                    often lacked quality or contained harmful chemicals. As a pharmacist, I could read the
                    ingredients and knew which chemicals promised temporary beauty but caused long-term damage.</p>

                <p>During the economic downturn, my frustration peaked. Trusted products disappeared or became too
                    expensive. That's when I decided I had to find a solution—not just for me, but for every girl
                    facing the same struggle.</p>

                <p>I went back to studying from scratch, like I did in college, embarking on a long journey of
                    research and experiments to develop a truly natural formula.</p>

                <p>The journey wasn’t easy. I was torn between fear of failure and excitement about solving many
                    problems. But I was certain the product would be 100% natural and harmless. I asked testers to
                    give honest feedback, highlighting flaws before benefits, so I could improve.</p>

                <p>The biggest challenge was convincing people that natural products don't need to "smell fancy" or
                    look glossy. Ingredients like horsetail and lanolin have strong scents, but their benefits are
                    worth it.</p>

                <p>The most rewarding moment came when people began requesting the product before I even had labels
                    or a sales page! Messages asking for large bottles in the morning showed me that my passion was
                    worth it.</p>

                <p>VeraCare is more than products—it’s the result of a journey of research, passion, and
                    persistence. We now have a dedicated team continuously developing and improving formulas for the
                    best results. We believe in your natural beauty and that every girl deserves confidence without
                    hiding flaws. Our products help girls embrace their natural, healthy hair, free from excessive
                    heat styling.</p>

                <p>VeraCare is my promise of honesty and transparency. Every product carries the trust and safety
                    you dream of, and I’ll be with you every step of the way toward your most beautiful, natural
                    self.</p>
